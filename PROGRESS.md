# PROGRESS

The live state of `PLAN.md`. Tick a box only when its step is done and
committed. A session that starts here resumes at the first unticked box.

## Milestones

- [x] **M0** — the two compilers built and commissioned
- [ ] **M1** — the recall suite (`known/`) run at both compilers and matched
- [ ] **M2** — the generator, the runner and the classifier
- [ ] **M3** — the recall gate: the grid re-finds every known defect at `c3bdae2`
- [ ] **M4** — CALIBRATION CHECKPOINT: ~100 cells at HUNT, then **stop and wait**
- [ ] **M5** — the hunt
- [ ] **M6** — the report

## Compilers

| role | commit | subject | `npkc.ll` bytes / sha256 | build time |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| baseline | `c3bdae2` (`c3bdae270d63c93ab6e89825fddeec9425e2c6fd`), 2026-09-25 07:06:41 -0400 | 1.5.8d steps 1-3: the close of cycle 1.5 | 28 111 929 / `4029fc70efbe9cd3…` | 67 s |
| hunt | `6fb85d3` (`6fb85d3d834fb7d5568ab996005f800d6d269e8f`), 2026-09-25 18:25:47 -0400 | 1.6.0 step 3f: DEF-99 — `NITPICK-TYPE-084` refuses the move out of `fixed` | 28 132 333 / `25eb7ee168604005…` | 69 s |

Other build products (M0.5):

| role | `npkc` bytes / sha256 | `npkrt.o` bytes / sha256 |
|---|---|---|
| baseline | 9 724 232 / `0cbc150ced5d20f7…` | 72 576 / `162b897539285a77…` |
| hunt | 9 739 968 / `a81223d352d316be…` | 72 576 / `162b897539285a77…` |

**Commissioning check (M0.5): PASSED.** The baseline's `.internal/quickemit/npkc.ll`
is exactly 28 111 929 bytes with sha256 `4029fc70efbe9cd3…`, as GitHub's CI
printed. The emission is identical on this machine.

**LLVM:** `.work/llvm/bin/llvm-config --version` prints `20.1.2` (the
`LLVM-20.1.2-Linux-X64` release tarball, downloaded and extracted by the
command in PLAN.md 0.2).

**Canaries (M0.6), both compilers:** `commission/canary.npk` — npkc rc 0, links,
runs to 0 on the -O0 leg and on the -O2 leg. `commission/canary_malformed.npk`
— npkc rc 1, prints `NITPICK-PARSE-001`, writes no `.ll`.

This is not the 4-vCPU cloud VM `PLAN.md` describes; it is the author's local
machine (the session was dispatched here by the workbench). See decision S1.

## Decisions and deviations

- **S1 — parallelism stays at 4 jobs** although the machine has 48 cores.
  CLAUDE.md rule 7 states the cap as a rule; the plan's timings were written for
  4 jobs and the recorded costs are meant to be comparable with a cloud run.
- **S2 — the work is on branch `claude/fuzzing-session-milestones-xiv0ni`**,
  not `main`, because the session's harness instructions name that branch.
  Every push goes there; the author merges.
- **S3 — `gen/run_known.py`'s line format.** A leg not built (npkc refused)
  prints `-`; a run that hits the 10-second timeout prints `T`; a signal
  death prints 128+N; a leg whose `opt`/`llc`/`ld.lld` step fails prints
  `opt!N`/`llc!N`/`ld!N`. Build products go to a temporary directory, never
  beside `known/`.

## Log

- 2026-09-25 (session 1, this branch): started at M0.1 with nothing ticked.
  M0 done: LLVM 20.1.2 fetched, compiler cloned, `base` (c3bdae2) and `hunt`
  (6fb85d3) worktrees built in 67 s / 69 s, digests recorded, both commissioned.
